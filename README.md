#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

**Software engineering** is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing and maintaining software.
**Reliability**- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 

**Efficiency** - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.

**Scalability and flexibility** - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.
 
**Security** - implement protection practice like authentication, authorization and encryption to secure users information.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1.**	Birth of Software Engineering (1968)** – The term was introduced at a NATO conference to address the software crisis, where projects failed due to complexity and poor management. This led to structured programming and better development practices.

2.	**Object-Oriented Programming (1970s-1980s)** – OOP introduced concepts like encapsulation, modularity, and reusability, making software easier to maintain and scale. Languages like Smalltalk, C++, and Java popularized this approach.

3.	**Agile Manifesto (2001)** – Agile replaced rigid development models with flexible, iterative approaches, focusing on customer collaboration and adaptability. Methods like Scrum and Kanban improved software delivery speed and efficiency.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of several phases, including:
  - **Requirements**: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - **Design**: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - **Implementation**: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - **Testing**: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - **Deployment**: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - **Maintenance**: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

**Waterfall methodology **
- Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall. 
- there is Low flexibility, changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
 - Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
 - Testing is done at the end of the development process.


**Agile methodology** 
- Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. 
- High flexibility, adapts to changing requirements. 
- Regular customer feedback is incorporated into every sprint. 
- Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

**Software Developer** - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
 - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
- collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software.
 - reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
 - 
**Quality Assurance Engineer** - collaborate with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
 - create development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow
 - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment. 
- analyse the product to identify bugs and suggest changes to make them more efficient. 
- develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
- 
**Project Manager** - assembles and lead the software development team.
 - discuss the project and it's requirement with the client and software developers.
 - create blueprint for the project.
 - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
 - deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**: Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA). It improves coding efficiency by automating tasks and providing smart features. It formats text with colors and styles for readability, highlights syntax errors, and suggests code completions. It also compiles code, automates unit tests, and includes debugging tools that help identify errors in real time. These features enhance programmer productivity and streamline development.

**Version Control Systems (VCS)**: Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion). Version control is important for collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work without conflicts. It enables change tracking, branching and merging for new features, and error recovery by reverting to previous versions if needed.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

**Changing Requirements**: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
- Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
- **Technical Debt**: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
**Strategies for Overcoming Challenges**: Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

- **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  
- **Integration Testing**: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
 
- **System Testing**: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
   
- **Acceptance Testing**: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
    
**Importance of Quality Control**: Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.

Importance:

**Improved user experience** - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.

**Increased flexibility** - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

**Developer control** - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

**Vague Prompt:**

Tell me about technology.

**Improved Prompt:**

Explain how artificial intelligence is used in healthcare, including specific examples of its applications and benefits.

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

1.	Clear – The improved prompt clearly defines the topic (AI in healthcare) and what is expected (explanation, applications, and benefits), avoiding ambiguity.

2.	Specific – It narrows the focus to a particular aspect of technology (AI) and its use in a defined field (healthcare), preventing an overly broad response.

3.	Concise – The prompt is direct and to the point, ensuring all necessary details are included without unnecessary words, making it easy to understand.
